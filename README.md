# 📝 Todo List App (React)

This is a simple Todo List App I built while learning React.
The goal of this project was to practice the core concepts of React such as:

Using useState for managing input and task lists

Handling form submissions and controlled components

Passing props between components

Using useEffect to persist data in localStorage

Building reusable components (TodoHeader & TodoTasks)

Styling with CSS & Flexbox for clean layout

## 🚀 Features

Add new tasks

Delete tasks

Tasks are saved in localStorage (they remain after refresh)

Responsive and styled with custom CSS

Hover effects on buttons & icons for better UI

## 🎯 Learning Experience

This project helped me understand the fundamentals of React:

How state and props work together

The importance of immutability when updating arrays

Why useEffect runs after rendering, and how to use it for side effects like saving data

The difference between string state vs array state

Debugging issues with localStorage and JSON parsing

How to align UI elements properly using Flexbox (justify-content, align-items, and gap)

It also taught me some best practices:

Keep components small and reusable

Pass functions as props to handle actions like delete

Use map with key to render lists

Use index-based delete logic to avoid issues with duplicate tasks
